# Version
This is version 1.0 of Mini-Games. Further versions will contain greater content.

# How to play
1. Rock-Paper-Scissors: How rock-paper-scissors is played. You should know but I'll explain it anyway. 1 player chooses rock/paper/scissors and the other does the same. They both play it and rock wins over scissors, paper wins over rock, and scissors wins over paper.
2. Guess the Number: You have to guess a number. The range will be mentioned in the question.
3. Odd-Even: 1 player chooses odd and the other even. They both then play a number from 0-9 (inclusive). If the sum of the numbers they played adds up to even, the player who chose even wins, otherwise if it adds up to odd, the player who chose odd wins.
